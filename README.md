## Dataset
The Ford GoBikes dataset explores data of approximately 183400 bike riders in the month of February 2019. The features of the dataset include the trip start and end time, trip duration, user type, gender, and age. There were about 8200 missing values in age and gender attribute and few age outliers which was removed.


## Summary
In the exploration phase, I noticed that there are 3 types of gender: male, female and other with male gender generally taking more bike trips and female gender taking longer bike trips. I also discovered that there are two type of user types of the ford Gobike system: Subscribers with monthly subscription uses the bike system on daily basis especially during the weekday at 8am and 5pm to commute to and from work or school and customers who are casual riders usually use the bike system on the weekend for pleasure and tourism around the Bay Area. 


## Key insight
About 74\% of total bikers are male, and 23\% are female. There are about 90\% subscribers and about 9\% casual customers. The Ford Gobike system is used mostly during weekdays with customers generally taking longer trips especially during the weekends.\
Age group and user type of riders affects the usage of the Ford Gobike. Subscribers who fall in the age group between 26-35 years old are the most common age group to use the bike sharing system. Both subscribers and customers between the ages of 26-35 years old also lead the spike which occurs across all age groups throughout the week with a large decline in the usage between Thursday and Friday.\
Finally, it appears riders between the ages of 46-60 years old uses the bike system the least but takes long trips than riders between the ages of 26-35 and 36-45 years old
